    "\n",
    "Consider a bakery that has had a successful storefront location in for several years. They have just decided that they would like to expand their business into food carts in the downtown area, in order to capitalize on the increased foot traffic there. The problem is that their storefront is quite large, and any food cart they operate will have much less space on the counter to  display their products. In order to decide which products they should sell at their food carts, they decide to hire a programmer to write an optimization model that maximize profit while only selling P products. They also decide that they want to see which items would be most profitable during every hour that they are open- based on their storefront sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to solve an example of this problem, we have taken a large(21,293 samples) dataset from the internet([kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/sulmansarwar/transactions-from-a-bakery). This dataset contains real transactions from a bakery, and records the date and time of the transaction, and the name of the item solve in that transaction. In order to get this data into a form that we can use, we must do some parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we don't care about the date in this problem, we must first parse the time and see how many sales are made at each hour. We disregard hours where there are not meaningful sales(relative to the size of the dataset) and create a list of times that **are** meaningful to us. Then we parse the items sold, and disregard items that are not meaningful to us(ie. there are very few sales done in the entire dataset) and create a list of these item names. From here we are ready to create and run the optimization model on this data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: The dataset did not provide price points for the items sold, so we supplied arbritrary prices that seemed to fit the item being sold**\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows, we will lay out the mathematical model that helps us solve this problem, the variables involved, and the results of the model.\n"

    "## Mathematical model ##\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to solve this problem and arrive at the P items that should be sold, we have to formulate\n",
    "a MIP(Mixed Integer Program). We need this sort of model because we need the decisions\n",
    "variables that represent the items that **could** be sold at the food carts to be either 1 or 0\n",
    "after we run the solver. This is because we just need to know if we should sell an item(1) or \n",
    "not(0). The maximization objective is not restricted to being an integer, because we have to use the price of the product, which is not necessarily an integer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are trying to optimize products sold at each hour of operation, we will need to create models, variables, and constraints iteratively over these hours. For each hour we iterate over the data and check if the timestamp is the same as the hour we are currently optimizing. If it is, we add that item to the current model. \n",
    "\n",
    "We create a constraint that sums all of the possible items to sell- z[1] - z[37] in this case. We restrict this sum to being less than or equal to the total number of items the bakery would like to sell- in this example we solve for five items. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then create an objective function that sums each decision variable z times the price of that item times the number of that item sold during that hour. This will maximize the profit of each item, and the model will pick the five items that maximize the total profit at the food cart. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a mathematical look at our model:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "  {\\text{maximize}}\\qquad& \\sum_{n=1}^{P} Z_i  J_i && i=1,\\dots,P && Z_i \\in [1,0]\\\\\n",
    "    \\text{subject to:}\\qquad& \\sum_{n=1}^{P} Z_i \\le M  && i=1,\\dots,P && Z_i \\in [1,0]\\\\\n",
    "    \\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here P is the number of products we are considering, Z's are the decision variables, J's are the price of that item, and M is the maximum number of items that we can sell."

    "\n",
    "It is important to note that these results only show the most popular items that were sold at the storefront at those times. We cannot necessarily extrapolate these findings onto food cart sales, because there is likely a very different customer base, and there are other things to take into consideration when considering foods to sell. \n",
    "\n",
    "At a food cart, there is limited ability to make or store certain items that would require extra equipment. Would this extra space requirement make any items infeasible or unprofitable to sell? it is certainly possible. Also, since we are considering swapping out items at each hour of the day, then we might also consider the cost of changing the display, and the space requirement to store these additional items behind the counter. \n",

    "Given the output of our model, we can conclude that we should **definitely** sell coffee and cake at every hour of business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides these popular items, we can draw other conclusions. We see that sandwiches are very popular during the middle of the day, so we could reasonable plan on selling them for lunch, but possibly changing that item's spot for something else during the morning and nighttime. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a future model that expands on this one, we could further modify the constraints so that we take into account the cost of changing out an item, and the storage space behind the counter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Is there a possibility of selling out of a certain item because we can only store a certain amount of it behind the counter? Then we might consider the maximum amount of an item that can be stored, and the corresponding maximum profit of that item, and instead of summing the decision variables times their price, we could sum the decision variables times the total profit of that item. This would create a better output if certain items will take up so much space that their profit does not make it worthwhile selling.\n"
